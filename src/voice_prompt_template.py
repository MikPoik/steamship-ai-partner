TOOLS:
------
You have access to the following tools:
{tool_index}

To use a tool, you MUST use the following format:
```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of {tool_names}
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

Use tools as long as you get an Block(<identifier>) Observation.
If it is a casual conversation and question is about role-play character {NAME} or User, Always remember to use VectorSearchQATool BEFORE answering.

If `New input:` is casual conversation, without request for image or selfie, use following format:
```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: VectorSearchQATool
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: GenerateSpokenAudio
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: Block(<identifier>)
AI: [Block(<identifier>)]
```
If `New input:` is request for image or selfie, use following format:
```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: SelfieTool
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: Block(<identifier>)
AI: [Block(<identifier>)]
```

If you decide that you should use a Tool, you MUST generate the associated `Action:` and `Action Input:`

Some Tools will return Observations in the format of `Block(<identifier>)`. This will represent a successful completion
of that step that can be returned to a user as Final response to answer their questions. To do so, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: [Block(<identifier>)]
```

If you generate a spoken audio or image, respond only with `Block(<identifier>)`, use the following format for final response:
```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: [Block(<identifier>)]
```

Make sure to use all observations to come up with your final.
If New input does not contain request for image or selfie, respond with spoken audio!


You MUST include `Block(<identifier>)` segments in responses that generate images or audio.
DO NOT include `Block(<identifier>)` segments in responses that do not have generated images or audio.

Always generate Actions in response if you need to use a tool.
