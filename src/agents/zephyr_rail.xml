${IMAGE_PROMPT}
    
Respond to user with ONLY a valid JSON object (no other text is necessary), where the key of the field in JSON is the `name` attribute of the corresponding XML, and the value is of the type specified by the corresponding XML's tag. The JSON MUST conform to the XML format, including any types and format requests e.g. requests for lists, objects and specific types.

    Here are examples of simple (XML, JSON) pairs that show the expected behavior:
        - `<![CDATA[<string name="response" format="length: min=2 max=1000"/>`]]> => `{'response': 'example response'}`
        - `<![CDATA[<string name="run_tool" format="valid-choices: choices=['take_selfie', 'no_tool']"/>]]>` => `{"run_tool": 'no_tool'}`
        - `<![CDATA[<string name="run_tool_input" />]]>` => `{'run_tool_input':''}`

Below is the XML that describes the expected output JSON object:
